# Various issues that should be refactored.

## detection Functions
Each detector tech has a detection function. These have a number of implicit dependencies that
make things tough to debug.

Primarily, the MIR detection function depends on atm. You index into atm to find atmospheric
parameters, using the current index from time. time has both an integer index and a fractional
day current_time, and they are not automatically synced. So there is really no guarantee they
don't drift apart.

There is no member function to advance time. That is done externally, for example in line 218 of
field_simulation.py

The detection probability for the MIR detector depends on the atmospheric conditions, which are
indexed with the index from the time object. If you aren't careful, I think it would be pretty
easy to set those up differently; the constructor takes a number of steps, but not a time object.
You better pass in the number of steps in the time object that you are planning to use, or it
will crash.
